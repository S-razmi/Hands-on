# Hands-On Instructions for Machine Learning and Statistical Inference Courses

This repository contains hands-on instructions for the courses Machine Learning and Statistical Inference, in which I was a teaching assistant during the fall of 2023.

## Machine Learning Hands-On

In the Machine Learning hands-on, we discuss different ensemble learning algorithms such as bagging, boosting, and stacking. We also get familiar with popular models in each class and learn their API in Scikit-learn. Finally, we evaluate their performance.

## Statistical Learning Hands-On

In the Statistical Learning hands-on, we have three different sessions. The first one is about contingency tables and their use. The second one is about non-parametric tests, and the third one is about the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We get familiar with these concepts, their applications, and how to perform them using their API in Python.

## How to Use

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and navigate to the corresponding directory for each hands-on session. Each directory contains a README file with detailed instructions on how to perform the tasks discussed in the course.
